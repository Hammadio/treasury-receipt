# Business Rules Management Guide

This guide helps you manage business rules for the Payment Voucher Creation Agent based on feedback from your budgeting team.

## üéØ Overview

The Payment Voucher system now uses a flexible business rules engine that allows you to:
- Add new classification rules without coding
- Modify existing rules based on user feedback
- Test rules before applying them
- Export/import rules for backup and sharing

## üìÅ Files Overview

- **`business_rules.json`** - Main configuration file (auto-generated)
- **`business_rules_editor.py`** - Full interactive editor
- **`add_business_rules.py`** - Quick rule addition tool
- **`business_rules_config.py`** - Core rules engine

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Add a Single Rule (Recommended for beginners)

Define how transactions are categorized based on:
- **Keywords** in the description
- **GL Account patterns** (e.g., "6*" for expense accounts)
- **Amount ranges** (e.g., $0-$10,000)
- **Priority** (higher numbers = more important)

### Approval Rules
Define approval workflows based on:
- **Amount thresholds**
- **Transaction categories**
- **Required approvers**
- **Escalation rules**

### Validation Rules
Define validation requirements:
- **Amount limits**
- **GL account validation**
- **Compliance checks**
- **Error messages**

## üìù Rule Examples

### Example 1: Office Supplies

  "name": "Office Supplies",
  "keywords": ["office supplies", "stationery", "pens", "paper"],
  "gl_account_patterns": ["6*", "601*"],
  "category": "Operating",
  "subcategory": "Office Supplies",
  "priority": 100
}
```

### Example 2: IT Equipment
```json
{
  "rule_id": "CAP-001", 
  "name": "IT Equipment",
  "keywords": ["computer", "laptop", "software", "hardware"],
  "gl_account_patterns": ["1*", "11*"],
  "category": "Capital",
  "subcategory": "IT Equipment",
  "priority": 100
}
```

### Example 3: High-Value Approval
```json
{
  "rule_id": "APP-003",
  "name": "Executive Approval",
  "conditions": {"min_amount": 100000},
  "approval_level": "Executive",
  "required_approvers": ["Department Head", "Finance Director", "Executive"]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices

### 1. Rule Naming
- Use consistent prefixes: `OP-` for Operating, `CAP-` for Capital, etc.
- Use descriptive names: "Office Supplies" not "Rule1"
- Include version numbers for major changes: "OP-001-v2"

### 2. Keywords
- Use specific terms: "office supplies" not "supplies"
- Include variations: "computer", "laptop", "desktop"
- Test keywords with real transaction descriptions

### 3. GL Account Patterns
- Use wildcards: "6*" for all expense accounts
- Be specific when needed: "601*" for specific expense types
- Test patterns with your actual GL accounts

### 4. Priority
- Higher numbers = higher priority
- Specific rules should have higher priority than general ones
- Default: 100 for most rules, 50 for catch-all rules

### 5. Testing
- Always test new rules before deploying
- Test with edge cases and unusual descriptions
- Validate with your business users

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Matching
1. Check keywords are spelled correctly
2. Verify GL account patterns match your COA
3. Ensure amount is within specified ranges
4. Check rule priority and active status

### Wrong Classification
1. Review keyword matches
2. Check for conflicting rules
3. Adjust rule priority
4. Add more specific keywords

### Approval Issues
1. Verify approval rules are active
2. Check amount thresholds
3. Ensure approver roles are correct
4. Review escalation rules
